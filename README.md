# RiotLauncher

Launches Riot Games' games in a custom way.

Since this is for my own personal use, and not meant to be functional out of the box for anyone, I won't give any instructions on usage.

The repo is only here for reference.

### Features

 - Allows any language to be chosen in any League region
 - Enables use of PBE client on live servers
 - Includes stripped down version of [Deceive](https://github.com/aPinat/Deceive)
 - Includes a transparent LCDS proxy, because somehow the native LCU <-> LCDS TCP connection keep failing with TCP Resets on me
